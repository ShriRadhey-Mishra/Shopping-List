## About CartWhisper

CartWhisper is a learning project, that I built while practicing my Web Development Basics. This is a completely dynamic app, for which I have used DOM Manipulation. 

This app shows you a list of item that you wish to buy. Once you buy the item, you can remove the item from your list. You can add items to the list. You can search for items in the list. There is also a checkbox which hides the list.

## Tech Stack Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- DOM Manipulation

## How you can use CartWhisper

- You can search for items int the "Search Item" input box at the top. It will show only the items that matches the input.
- You can hide and unhide the list by clicking the "Hide List" checkbox.
- You can add more item to the list by entering the item to the "What do you want to buy" input box and clicking the Add button (or pressing 'Enter').
- You can remove the items from the list by clicking the "remove" button

## My Learning

I learned how to structure a web page using HTML, and style it using a CSS stylesheet. 
I have used JavaScript to make DOM Manipulation. I have used the concepts such as **Event Delegation**, **Event Bubbling**, **DOM Traversal** and many more, to make this app dynamic.

## Future Addition

- Right now, this is just a frontend application. I will create a server for this using NodeJS + ExpressJS, and create API so the frontend and the backend can communicate.
- As of now, the data you add, and remove goes nowhere. I will create a MongoDB connection which will store user data, so newly added data dont get erased once the app is refreshed.
- This app right now only works for single user. I will add a sign-in/ sign-up functionality, so individual user can see their own list.
- Since the purpose of this project is to learn and apply new concepts, I will add authorization and authentication.

This is just the beginning, I will develop more projects as I learn.

Stay tuned!
